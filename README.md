Introduction:
In the fast-paced world of crypto trading, speed and precision can mean the difference between profit and loss. Front-running—executing trades ahead of large transactions—offers a strategic edge for savvy traders. Manually seizing these opportunities is tough, but FredAiCoder-Ai-DEX-FrontRun-JS-Bot-V4 streamlines and automates the process. This article explores how the bot works, its key features, and how it can amplify your crypto profits.

1. What Is Front-Running?
Front-running is a trading tactic that leverages early knowledge of large upcoming transactions. For instance, if a massive buy order is detected, a front-runner can purchase beforehand and sell post-surge. Success hinges on split-second decisions and accurate data.

3. Weighing the Gains and Risks:
While front-running can lead to substantial returns, it comes with risks—market swings, failed transactions, and regulatory grey areas.

Whenever you use a decentralized exchange to swap tokens, the price of the token you buy increases slightly. This is called slippage and for most retail traders, slippage is barely even noticeable. Whale traders however, especially when they purchase highly illiquid tokens, can significantly change a token’s price.Frontrunning bots take advantage of this mechanic by beating out the trader on the gas fees, purchasing into a token at the lower price and then instantly selling them off at the higher price. In a block explorer, frontruns leave a clear trace with the trader’s transaction being sandwiched between the two frontrun transactions. #coding #frontrunningbot #javascript #tutorial #botv4 #dex #programming #configuration #learntocode #stepbystep #beginner
